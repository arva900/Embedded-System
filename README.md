# Embedded-System
Designed and implemented a robust MSP430-based embedded system with real-time control of sensors and motors.
Developed layered firmware architecture with FSM kernel, enhancing maintainability and real-time reliability.
Established an UART communication protocol using compressed data, reducing transmission overhead while
ensuring high throughput, fault tolerance, and robust error detection with retransmission mechanisms.
Created multithreaded Python GUI for asynchronous serial communication, data visualization, user
configuration, and system control.
